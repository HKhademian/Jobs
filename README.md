## Summery
This project selected as top 7 projects that compete in final round.
They say the final is in three field:
1. UI Design
2. core, code and logic
3. Function and Implementation

I work on last two and create acceptable ui, but in contest day, they joined 3 fields and judge (70-80%) on the ui

Unfortunently my project became 6th of 7 projects.
