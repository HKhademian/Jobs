I wish I had time to add `Dagger` or `koin` (I'm new to these :D ) and used Jetpack AndroidX replacement for support library

## Result
This project selected as top 7 projects that compete in final round.

They say the final is in three field:
1. UI Design
2. core, code and logic
3. Function and Implementation

I work on last two and create acceptable ui in just only 2-3 days delivvery window.
but in contest day, the Jury change because of tv broadcasting rules (I think), the new Jury joined 3 fields togetther and judge (70-80%) on the ui, and I could't do any thing for that. Unfortunently my project became 6th of 7 projects. But (a big one) the whole competitors in the contest said if my project is the best (but what a chance :D )
